# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: This is a keyword that refers to an object. The object depends on the scope that this is used in. For example, within a method, this refers to the object that the method resides in.

  Researched answer: On its own, this refers to the global object. In strict mode, this is always undefined. The value of this cannot be changed. 



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a library for creating user interfaces. You would use it to automate simple processes. Meaning, without react, you would have to code each instance of a data change and a change with the DOM. It would be similar to logging your starting point and end point of a trip vs, recording your starting point, each stopping point, then the end point of a trip. One would be significantly shorter than the other. React shortens alot of the processes that would otherwise need to be hard coded.

  Researched answer: It is used to handle the layer of an app that will be accessed by users. It is also useful, as it utilizes JSX and a VDOM to shorten many processes of coding. 



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: The render method is always required for class components so that updates from the HTML can be updated to the DOM automatically. 

  Researched answer: The render method helps by displaying code and updates to code, live, without refreshing a webpage. 



4. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is a syntax extension of javascript that allows you to code HTML inside of javascript code. HTML can return multiple elements, while JSX can only return one. 

  Researched answer: HTML is a language, while JSX is an extention of the Javascript language.



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is a software tool that monitors and modifies software that you code, and allows you to share it. 

  Researched answer: The yarn.lock file is created and nodes packages are updated when yarn is run.



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: An anonymous function is an undefined funtion.

  Researched answer: It provides a way to callback to functions without naming each one. 


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: Components that render based on certain arguements being true and/or false.

2. Object-oriented programming: Method of programming that is structured as a library of parameters that can be reused. Essentially, basing the structure of your entire program on the basis that everything is an object, all inside on big object.

3. Ruby: An open source programming language that is used for front and backend development. 

4. Ruby blocks: Code that can be executed later, through anonymous functions. 

5. Ruby hashes: The equivalent of key:value pairs, but in Ruby.
